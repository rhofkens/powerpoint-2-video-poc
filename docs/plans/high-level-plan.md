# PowerPoint to Video POC - High-Level Implementation Plan

## Overview
This implementation plan breaks down the PowerPoint to Video POC into seven meaningful increments, each delivering testable value. The plan follows the workflow defined in the PRD: Upload → Parse → Render → Analyze → Generate Narratives → Display Results → Generate Media → Compile Full Video.

## Implementation Increments

| Increment Title | Scope | High-Level Acceptance Criteria | Documentation Tasks |
| --------------- | ----- | ------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| Project Setup & Infrastructure | Set up monorepo structure, initialize Spring Boot backend with PostgreSQL database, integrate existing Lovable React frontend, establish basic REST communication | - Backend runs with health endpoint<br>- PostgreSQL connected and schema created<br>- Frontend displays data from backend<br>- Environment variables configured | Create setup guide with prerequisites and installation steps |
| File Upload & PowerPoint Parsing | Implement file upload API, integrate Apache POI for PPTX parsing, extract slides with text and images, store in database | - Upload endpoint accepts PPTX files<br>- Slides extracted with content preserved<br>- Data persisted to PostgreSQL<br>- Frontend shows upload progress | Document API endpoints and database schema |
| MS Graph API Slide Rendering | Integrate Microsoft Graph API for high-fidelity slide rendering, implement PDF conversion and SharePoint preview methods, provide cloud-native HD rendering option | - MS Graph authentication configured<br>- HD slide images (1920x1080) generated<br>- Both PDF and SharePoint methods working<br>- Seamless fallback to other renderers | Document MS Graph setup, API configuration, and rendering workflow |
| AI Integration & Content Analysis | Configure Spring AI with OpenAI, implement slide analysis, generate narratives with emotions and speaker notes | - OpenAI API integrated successfully<br>- Each slide analyzed for context<br>- Narratives generated with emotions<br>- Speaker notes incorporated | Document AI prompt templates and integration approach |
| Results Visualization Dashboard | Create results display UI, implement Zustand state management, show narratives with emotion indicators, enable narrative editing | - All slides displayed with narratives<br>- Emotions clearly indicated<br>- Edit functionality works<br>- State persists during edits | Create user guide for results interface |
| Media Generation | Integrate ElevenLabs for audio generation, integrate D-ID for avatar videos, implement progress tracking | - Audio files generated for each slide<br>- Avatar videos created successfully<br>- Progress shown in real-time<br>- Files stored appropriately | Document media generation workflow and API usage |
| Full Video Compilation | Implement video compilation logic, synchronize audio/video with slides, generate final downloadable video | - Complete video generated<br>- Timing synchronized correctly<br>- Video downloadable by user<br>- Processing time acceptable | Create end-to-end workflow documentation |

## Success Metrics
- Technical feasibility validated
- Processing time for 10-slide presentation under 5 minutes
- Narrative quality with appropriate emotional styling
- All external APIs integrated successfully
