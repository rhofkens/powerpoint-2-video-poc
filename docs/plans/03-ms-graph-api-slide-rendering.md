# Step 3: MS Graph API Slide Rendering - Detailed Implementation Plan

## Overview
This increment adds Microsoft Graph API as a cloud-native slide rendering option to provide high-fidelity HD rendering (1920x1080px) of PowerPoint slides. The implementation will support both PDF conversion and SharePoint preview methods, with seamless fallback to existing renderers.

## Detailed Scope

### Features Included
1. **MS Graph Authentication Setup**
   - Configure Azure AD application registration
   - Implement Client Credentials flow for server-to-server authentication
   - Set up required Graph API permissions (Files.ReadWrite.All, Sites.ReadWrite.All)
   - Create secure credential management using Spring Boot configuration

2. **MSGraphService Implementation**
   - File upload to OneDrive functionality
   - PDF conversion capabilities using Graph API
   - SharePoint document library integration
   - High-resolution thumbnail generation
   - Temporary file cleanup mechanisms
   - Error handling and retry logic with exponential backoff

3. **MSGraphSlideRenderer Strategy**
   - Implement SlideRendererStrategy interface
   - PDF conversion method (primary approach)
   - SharePoint preview API method (fallback approach)
   - Image processing to ensure 1920x1080px output
   - Integration with existing SlideRendererFactory

4. **Configuration and Dependencies**
   - Add Microsoft Graph SDK dependencies (v6.48.0)
   - Add Azure Identity SDK for authentication (v1.11.0)
   - Configure application properties for Graph API
   - Update renderer priority configuration

5. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Batch processing for multiple slides
   - Parallel slide generation where possible
   - Caching mechanism for rendered slides
   - Efficient file upload/download strategies

### Explicitly Excluded
- User-specific OneDrive integration (only service account)
- Real-time collaboration features
- Direct PowerPoint Online integration
- Webhook-based notifications (future enhancement)
- Persistent cloud storage of presentations

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Authentication and Setup
- [ ] Azure AD app registration completed with correct permissions
- [ ] MS Graph client successfully authenticates using Client Credentials flow
- [ ] Configuration can be toggled on/off via application properties
- [ ] Credentials stored securely using environment variables
- [ ] Connection test endpoint confirms Graph API connectivity

### PDF Conversion Method
- [ ] PowerPoint file successfully uploads to OneDrive
- [ ] PDF conversion completes without errors for various PPTX formats
- [ ] PDF pages render at exactly 1920x1080px resolution
- [ ] Generated images maintain aspect ratio and quality
- [ ] Temporary files are cleaned up after processing

### SharePoint Preview Method
- [ ] PowerPoint file uploads to SharePoint document library
- [ ] Preview API generates high-resolution images
- [ ] Images are extracted and resized to 1920x1080px
- [ ] Method serves as reliable fallback when PDF conversion fails
- [ ] SharePoint temporary files are properly removed

### Integration and Error Handling
- [ ] MSGraphSlideRenderer integrates seamlessly with SlideRendererFactory
- [ ] Renderer priority configuration works as expected
- [ ] Graceful fallback to other renderers on Graph API failures
- [ ] Retry logic handles transient network issues
- [ ] Comprehensive error logging for troubleshooting

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] Single slide renders in under 5 seconds (excluding initial upload)
- [ ] Batch processing reduces total time for multi-slide presentations
- [ ] Parallel processing works for presentations with 10+ slides
- [ ] Memory usage stays within acceptable limits
- [ ] No memory leaks during extended operation

### Testing and Validation
- [ ] Unit tests cover all MSGraphService methods
- [ ] Integration tests verify end-to-end rendering workflow
- [ ] Performance tests validate rendering speed requirements
- [ ] Error scenarios are tested (auth failures, API limits, network issues)
- [ ] Different PowerPoint formats tested (PPTX, PPT with compatibility)

## Detailed Documentation Tasks

### API Documentation
- [ ] Document MS Graph API endpoints used in the implementation
- [ ] Create setup guide for Azure AD app registration
- [ ] Document required Graph API permissions (Files.ReadWrite.All, Sites.ReadWrite.All)
- [ ] Provide troubleshooting guide for common Graph API errors

### Configuration in README
- [ ] Add MS Graph configuration section to README with:
  - Required environment variables
  - Azure AD setup instructions
  - Example configuration snippets
  - Renderer priority configuration

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **API Rate Limits**: Implement request throttling and queue management
- **Storage Quotas**: Monitor OneDrive usage and implement cleanup policies
- **Network Latency**: Add configurable timeouts and retry policies
- **Authentication Expiry**: Implement token refresh mechanisms

### Operational Risks
- **Service Availability**: Ensure fallback renderers are always available
- **Data Privacy**: Implement immediate file deletion after processing
- **Cost Management**: Monitor API usage and implement usage alerts
- **Compliance**: Ensure data residency requirements are met

## Success Metrics
- MS Graph renderer successfully processes 95%+ of test presentations
- Average rendering time per slide under 5 seconds
- Zero data retention in OneDrive/SharePoint after processing
- Successful fallback to other renderers in 100% of failure cases
- Memory usage remains stable during extended operations
