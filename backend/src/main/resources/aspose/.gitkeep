# Aspose License Directory

Place your Aspose.Slides.lic file in this directory.

The license file is required for full functionality but is not included in the repository for security reasons.

To obtain a license:
1. Purchase or obtain an Aspose.Slides for Java license
2. Save the license file as `Aspose.Slides.lic` in this directory

Without a license file, the application will run in evaluation mode with limitations.

Note: The license file is already excluded from git via .gitignore
